            <p class="text-justify" id="postContent">Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social
                networking service company based in Menlo Park, California. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along
                with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz
                and Chris Hughes. It is considered one of the Big Four technology companies along with Amazon, Apple,
                and Google.
                The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students and subsequently Columbia,
                Stanford, and Yale students. Membership was eventually expanded to the remaining Ivy League schools,
                MIT, and higher education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly
                high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to
                become a registered user of Facebook, though this may vary depending on local laws.
